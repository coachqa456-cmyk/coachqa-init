# QEnabler Tool

## ✅ Why This App?

Modern software teams are moving away from classical QA (Quality Assurance) — where QA engineers own the testing — towards **QEnabler (QAa)**, where **everyone is responsible for quality**.

But in this shift, new challenges emerge:

- **QEs lose role clarity** — What does a QA coach *actually* do?
- **Quality is hard to measure** — Metrics focus on test coverage, not enablement.
- **Exploratory testing is invisible**, yet vital.
- **Testing maturity is uneven across squads**, with no easy way to assess or improve.
- **Test debt accumulates** with no ownership.
- **QE career paths become vague**, leading to disengagement.

QEnabler is built to solve all these.
